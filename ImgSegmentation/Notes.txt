Image Segmentation 
1. Object Detection 
    Algorithms for image Segmentation
    a. Supervised 
    b. Unsupervised 
    c. CNN ( convutional neural network )
    d. ANN ( Artificial neural network )
    e. SVM ( Support vector machine )
    f. K-nearest neighbour 
    g. Naive Based 
    h. Random forest algorithm 
    i. Mask R-CNN
    j. YoloR 
    h. YOLOv7 / v8. 
    i. Teralytics 

Try to use some sample of these algorithms 

Data for training - anotated one 
    a. ImageNet 
    b. LabelMe
    c. Google OID
    d. MS COCO

2. Link we can follow - There are lot of tutorials avaialble in Youtube. The point is 
where to start from. For example, you can start from a sample problem - and then do 
a kind of reverse search on how that can be solved, or otherwise, you will go in black 
hole with the kind of knowledge which you cannot digest. 

3. Deep learning algorithms - make notes using this

4. Problems i am interested in 
    a. count the number of fruits in the on-going video
    b. Find the growth of the plant as per day - how it should have been ideally and 
    how it is right now.
    c. Can we use satellite data to provide production related information?
    d. Capture Video, take photos out of it, process it and find out if that specific is a splant or not and if that plant is health or impacted by disease. Run this on a RPI. 
    e. A simple analysis of plant leaf - biotic or abiotic stress. 

Here is link that talks about the implementation in Agriculture
