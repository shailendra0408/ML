1. Simple Linear Regression - Single Indipendent variable ( Training pairs or regressors) 
and single response 
    𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑏₀ + 𝑏₁𝑥
    𝑏₀ = interept
    𝑏₁ = slope 

2. Multiple Regression - Two or More indipendent variables and single response.
3. Polynomial Regression 
4. Underfitting ( Low r^2 ) and Overfitting ( High R^2 with known data but low R^2 with new data)
