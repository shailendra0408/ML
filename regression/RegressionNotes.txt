Regression searches for relationship among varibles.

1. Simple Linear Regression - Single Indipendent variable ( Training pairs or regressors) 
and single response 
    𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑏₀ + 𝑏₁𝑥
    𝑏₀ = interept
    𝑏₁ = slope 
Tried 2 examples 
    a. With 10 sample data
    b. With  around 4000 data points of T, RH. 
    Temperature is not something that varried linearly, so a linear regression model 
    will not give you good forecast, but a polynomial regression might. 


    Now the Maths behind this is from the lecture 1 of the Advance ML course. 
    The regression coefficient can be find by using 
    h bar = (X Transpose X )^-1 X Transpose. 

2. Multiple Regression - Two or More indipendent variables and single response.
    a. Use ddifferent Sources - Here is one interesting - https://medium.com/swlh/multi-linear-regression-using-python-44bd0d10082d
    b. Another one - didn't tried it - https://aegis4048.github.io/mutiple_linear_regression_and_visualization_in_python

3. Polynomial Regression 
    a. Interesting read - https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-polynomial-regression-with-python-5328e4e8a386

4. Logistic Regression

    c. Smote ( Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique )  - Its a usefull tool that is used when there is a un-balenced data.

    d. Recursive Feature elimination - a feature of logistic regression 
    
        

4. Underfitting ( Low r^2 ) and Overfitting ( High R^2 with known data but low R^2 with new data)
