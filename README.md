# ML - Various models. 
The idea is to start with the basic of ML and eventually move torwards computer Vision, video analytics and forecasting. 

1. Regression  
2. Liniear Regression , Multiple Regression, Polynomial Regression 
3. Online Learing 
    a. LMS Mode - Least Mean Square Model 
4. Logistic Regression 
5. Perceptron Learning Algorithm
6. SVM - Support Vector machine 

Will add more with time. 

# Sample code with open source data and then with @Yuktix WS data. 

# Working with Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio 

1. The Jupyter was installed as a extension in the Visual Studio 
2. Now go to *View*, click on *new command Palatte* and write *new Jupyter Notebook*, it will open a .ipynb fie. 
3. Choose the correct version of python, on the right hand side of the IDE. 
4. Run the code. 




# ML - Still learning
Sample code for ML Signal Processing

As a part of this repo, i will be postig code with reference to Signal processing using following. 

1. Signal processing 
2. Python 
3. Numpy 
4. Google Colab 
5. Visual Code provide a option to install the juipter notebook. 

Later the same repo, i will extend to image processing
